Besides the obvious "play more games, write more reports", here's some things I still want to do:

[ ] A "what the hell is this page?" to explain myself a bit
[ ] Thumbnail images, maybe with nice rounded corners?
  - trad and journaling games generically
  - systems
  - campaigns/games
[ ] PC images/character sheets in a side bar
