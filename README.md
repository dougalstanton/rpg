Besides the obvious "play more games, write more reports", here's some things I still want to do:

- [ ] A "what the hell is this page?" to explain myself a bit
- [ ] Thumbnail images, maybe with nice rounded corners?
	- trad and journaling games generically
	- systems
	- campaigns/games
- [ ] Something in the side bar for each report
	- systems
	- character sheet
