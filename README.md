Besides the obvious "play more games, write more reports", here's some things I still want to do:

- [x] A "what the hell is this page?" to explain myself a bit
- [ ] Details of the systems used on a separate page
  - [x] YAML description of systems
  - [ ] Update all other front matter accordingly
  - [ ] Create summary page for these systems
- [ ] Thumbnail images, maybe with nice rounded corners?
  - trad and journaling games generically
  - systems
  - campaigns/games
- [ ] Something in the side bar for each report
  - systems
  - character sheet
