# Scene 1. Foggy Encounter

A straight dirt road through a foggy wood. Two travellers on horseback are talking as the horses walk steadily along the road. 

ORLEN is slightly ahead, on the finer horse and wearing the more expensive riding clothes. He is talking cheerfully and at length.

FORET is a pace or more behind, to his left. He speaks his mind freely but sparingly while watching the road and the woods around them. He draws even with ORLEN and speaks quietly, "the big bush ahead sir, on the right. Do you see it?"

"Aye I do, well spotted. Let us parlay." They stop and ORLEN calls out with forced cheer: "will you join us lad?"

Immediately a figure with a crossbow bursts from the forest on FORET's left. "I am no _lad_!" she shouts and points the weapon at ORLEN. "I need your mount, _sir_."

```
There's a roll here but first we need to establish some concrete details. She is a runaway from a temple, further details to be established.

MAHERA
- Occupation: Oracle (interpretation, rituals, trances)
- Background: Lost Child (hiding)
- Backpack:
	- Hourglass, 10 min. markers
	- Numbing herbs (3 uses)
	- Sewing kit
- Heavy crossbow (3 uses) (+1 burdens)

From her circumstances I expect the crossbow was stolen as she made her escape from the temple. She appears to have no obvious weapons training.

Risk roll: threaten the two strangers on horseback
Failure point: Accidental firing, hitting horse or rider, or lost to the woods
Failure point: Crossbow inexpertly armed
Failure point: Disarmed by bodyguard
Devil's Bargain: Remove/Land → step in a rabbit hole
+1 light for Crossbow, +1 light for Devil's Bargain, +1 dark for Risking Body → (4,3,5)

Success w/ Complication: She could never have fired the crossbow
Ruin increases by 1, so we should also establish her current Ruin.

Ruin: 3
Rituals:
- Doom (make a creature feel a sense of impending doom)
- Knock (open nearby portal that is shut)
```

ORLEN laughs and looks down at her. "It appears you do need a ride young Miss, as you appear to be, though I think your position of power is greatly diminished by the retaining cord on your crossbow."

MAHERA steps back to look at it and steps in a rabbit hole, collapsing as she does. "Fuck!"

"Foret, help the young lady up. In truth, my greeting was aimed at him" and he points casually down the road at a boy even younger than MAHERA, standing awkwardly near the trail.

FORET helps MAHERA up. "Are you hurt? Climb up onto Saskia here" and he rubs his hand affectionately on his horse's muzzle. They then walk slowly towards the boy on the trail.

"Let us do introductions all at once. I am Orlen. This is my riding companion Foret" - a nod - "and we are very pleased to make your acquaintance - Miss?"

This wasn't going at all how she'd planned but she hadn't the wit to think up a false name - "uh, Mahera...". She clutched the crossbow like a totem of protection rather than a weapon.

"And you young man?" ORLEN dropped to one knee. "Who are you and how can we be of assistance? I gather you two don't know each other" he said, looking between the girl on the horse and the boy in the road.

"I am... Esfahen" he said in a small voice.

```

What does that mean? It means he's a member of the royal family, that's what.

ESFAHEN
- Occupation: Lamb (innocence, sacrifice, rituals)
- Background: Usurped Royal (commands)

```

ORLEN laughs nervously, examining the boy's mud-splattered but now that you mention it obviously extremely costly clothes. "Well maybe you should join us too, for I don't think this wood is the right place for anyone to tarry."

# Scene 2. Arrival
```
Arrival at the Huntsman's Manor: Altered

Are there other treasure-seekers at the gates? Yes
Are there many? No but... they are official.
Official treasures seekers? I think maybe executors of the Marquess' will and whatever distant relations have come to claim it. There are (d4) 4 people in the party: one lawyer, two inheritors and an assistant.
```

"Hanging in pride of place, the Marquess was said to have claimed and stuffed the head of a dragon as a trophy of one storied hunt," said ORLEN. "That's what we're looking for."

"A dragon's head?!" squeals ESFAHEN. FORET hushes him as they see a small group ahead of them.

```
Have they opened the gate? No
Lets assume they're fiddling with a rusted lock and haven't yet got to brute force.
```

ORLEN and FORET exchange glances and agree to slip back into the trees. FORET steps down to sneak a closer look

```
This will be a Hunt Roll but for that we'll need to flesh out more of FORET's background.

FORET
- Occupation: Bodyguard (protection, speed, vigilance)
- Background: Expelled Apprentice (lore)
- Drive: Publish your discoveries from ancient Kalduhr
- Rituals (+2 Ruin):
	- Dryad (stay still to transform into a tree and communicate with other trees)
	- Orchard (conjure a few dozen apples, some poisonous)
- Backpack (starting 3):
	- Troll blood (heals 1 Ruin)
	- Jar of glowworms (3)
	- Vermin repellent (3 uses)
- Weapon: simple shortsword (+1 burden)

An expelled apprentice with two very vegetal rituals to his name. Was he going to be some kind of druid? Well, that's not important right now.

HUNT ROLL: Eavesdrop on the people at the gate
- +1 light die for vigilance
Rolled 3, 5: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible

Is the terrible thing about the party outside? No
There are beastbitten wolves feasting on a kill in the gardens.
```

FORET hears the group arguing about something just out of sight through the gates, which are being held shut by the group. They agree to return with reinforcements then quickly depart. Moving carefully FORET peeks through the rusted gate and sees several large wolves enjoying a fresh human kill.

```
Do the others remain out of sight in the forest? Yes but... someone looks back to see FORET staring through the gate before the forest fog hides them.
```

FORET and ORLEN discuss the situation in hushed tones. "We find ourselves in a predicament, sir."

```
UNE bearing: HOSTILE - JUDGMENT
```

"You doubt we can take on a pack of dogs? They've had their fill now."

```
How are the two junior members of the group holding up?

Mahera: SOCIABLE
Esfahen: CAUTIOUS
```

ESFAHEN is concerned that the group who just departed are coming back with more people who might recognise him. MAHERA insists they will find a disguise for him in the manor.

# Scene 3. The Overgrown Gardens

The gate squeals as they pull it open enough to slip inside.

```
Do the wolves look up from their kill? Yes but... they seem uninterested in another hunt.

Moment (d5) 3: A row of white roses has tangled to form one giant, thorned bush. The petals sting if touched.
```

FORET and ORLEN pull back their coats and cloaks to reveal their weapons but do not draw. They remain ready. MAHERA wishes they'd stopped a while outside the grounds to teach her how the crossbow works.

They convene behind tangled rose bush, dropping white petals on the windfall brambles, staining them red.

> "See, the dogs will be sated with their kill for some time. We shall enter directly."

```
Does anyone look closer (1=M, 2=E, 3=O, 4=F, 5=No)? (d5) 5

FORET has a horticultural leaning. Is he interested in exploring the garden? No

Okay, we're going into the manor. Before we go further, let's find out who the leader of this gang is.

ORLEN
- Occupation: Antiquarian (artifacts, myths, obfuscation)
- Background: Disinherited Noble (appraisal)
- Drive: Establish an estate in the Lovasti countryside
- Weapons (+2 burdens):
	- Dueling sabre
	- Leather gambeson
- Backpack:
	- Fishing net (silver)
	- 6 lead bottles
	- Magnet

TBD: Why was he disinherited?

Do the wolves stay feeding as they approach the manor doors? Yes
Moment (d4) 2: A clump of fur has been left caught on a branch. 
It is coarse and gray.
```

They make a careful crossing of the lawn, passing the wolves which all but ignore them. ORLEN takes the lead and FORET is at the back. MAHERA holds ESFAHEN's hand, to feel like she is helping.

```
I was about to do a Ruin roll for ESFAHEN here but that's the wrong game. 
Suffice it say, this is a bit frightening for him. He is, after all, 
an innocent Lamb being hunted by his family.
```

ESFAHEN is dragged past a low branch that is thick with grey wolf hair. He can smell the canine bloodlust, the terror of the hunt. He can feel again what it was like to slip between the blood-stained hands and run into the night.

The huge doors are guarded on either side by giant stone stags, their bodies facing straight out and their heads turned away from each other. Their huge antlers still nearly meet in the middle above their heads. ESFAHEN huddles between the stone legs while the others talk.

```
Who examines the door? (d4) 4=FORET

HUNT ROLL (+1 for vigilance)
Rolled (1, 6): Gain one Hunt Token
```

> "It doesn't look like it's been opened in a hundred years" said FORET.
> "Do wolves live outdoors? There might be a side entrance they use. There might be lots inside" said MAHERA.
> "Don't say that" said ESFAHEN.

# Scene 4. The Manor House
```
Does the door just open with the handle? No

I think it's time for our adventurers to put some effort in. FORET is going to try simply applying his shoulder to the door, for now. It may come to pass that ORLEN has to help out too.

Possible failures:
- someone opens the door from inside
- the doors close, splitting the party
- the stags come to life to defend the doorway

Devil's Bargain: FIGHT _(of)_ ATTENTION
↪ No matter what, this gets someone's attention. Is it the wolves? Yes

RISK ROLL
Rolled 1 light: Failure and things get worse

I'm going to re-roll with an extra dark die, letting ORLEN help out.

HELP ROLL
Weak point (d6) 1: only the children can defend them

RISK ROLL
Rolled 4 light, 3 dark: Success with complication
↪ door bursts open, both adventurers go sprawling while the wolves approach
```

After rattling the handle and pushing a few times, first FORET then ORLEN start to lean into the door with their shoulders. Some rusty catch inside snaps and both men go sprawling through the  doorway.

ESFAHEN has been sitting under the stone stag, watching the wolves warily. He lets out a whimper when they begin to stir, then when the door crashes open and the wolves hop to their feet he finally calls out "I think we've angered them".

MAHERA spins round with the crossbow raised in both hands. She tries to show calm and menace while struggling to hold its weight steady.

```
Do the wolves immediately stop? Yes
```

She talks quietly to her companions without turning around. "Walk me backwards through the doorway. I'm not taking my eyes off them."

```
Is the entry hall empty? Yes
```

ESFAHAN grabs the back of her cloak and side steps through the doorway, trying to hide behind MAHERA from the wolves. They stand in a loose semi-circle, still some distance out, watching.

Inside ORLEN and FORET have not recovered from the shock of bursting through the run-down exterior into the plush, well-groomed interior. Thick luxurious carpets and pelts, glowing candles and many hunting trophies. Each mounted head seems to wink at them from the darkness beyond the glow of the candles.

Two doorways lead north and south while a massive double staircase sweeps up towards an upper room.

```
Can they hear anything? Yes but... it doesn't sound threatening
Either (1) conversation (2) music (3) a roaring fire (4) laughter? (d4) 2=music
How do they react? CAUTIOUS
```

A hubbub of voices is audible from the room at the top of the stairs. ORLEN was just about to express surprise when a voice breaks into boisterous song. A joyful hunting song about the chase. They look at each other warily as ESFAHAN leads MAHERA into the manor.

> ESFAHAN: "Sirs..."
> MAHERA: "Get the door, please, someone..."
> ORLEN: "That might not be a wise move: we are not alone in here."

MAHERA hears the singing now and whirls around to take in their surroundings, to find somewhere to escape.

```
HUNT ROLL
Rolled 1, 1: Lose your Hunt Tokens and encounter something terrible
```

The song finishes with a dramatic huzzah and imitation wolf howls, which are taken up eagerly by other voices before falling to a convivial hubbub. ESFAHAN is rooted to the spot and clutching more desperately at MAHERA's jacket now. She whirls back around to see the circle of wolves standing closer to the door, still waiting. ORLEN and FORET quickly close the main door and usher the children through a doorway to the north wing.

# Scene 5. The North Wing
> ORLEN: "I think we have walked into a trap, hmm?"
> ESFAHAN: "Another one."
> "Are you hunted, then?"
> "My uncle's men were not happy when I slipped from their grasp."

They are in (`(d4) 2`) a small salon with a raised platform in the corner, and surrounded by comfortable chairs and side tables. Lit candles are shaded in their sconces.

> FORET: "There will be servant's corridors that lead through the back. If we hope to not meet anyone dangerous that seems the best way."

```
HUNT ROLL
Rolled 4: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible
```

FORET finds a hidden door, whose surface is painted to blend with the plaster walls. A small wolf's-head doorknob is hidden behind a curtain. He quickly lets go of the ornate doorknob to look at his now-bloodied hand. The wolf has extended its retractable fangs as the knob is turned, cutting into FORET's palm.

```
FORET gains the new Condition, Bitten by a Wolf Door
```

MAHERA takes a candle and her crossbow into the dark corners of the room.

```
HUNT ROLL
Rolled 1: Lose your Hunt Tokens and encounter something terrible
Is that (1) from her past, (2) new? (d2) 1
Spark? Plotting against an ally or colleague
↪ The temple were involved in the coup.
Chooose a religion (2d6) 2,6: Hafni, The Hunter

> "The great hunter prowls the shadowed paths of the Kalduhr Forest. The worship of Hafni recognizes the inherent tension in venerating the wood while also surviving by preying upon its creatures. Through prayer, Hafni’s worshippers accept the spirits of the forest’s animals into themselves; these hybrid souls’ killings are part of the cycle of predation. But some say they are changed by the experience, and now bear an eerie resemblance to the cursed beastbitten."

```

In the darkest corner of the salon is a small writing desk, with pen and ink pot and some bound volumes of political history lying open. A scrap of paper on top of the open books notes that the royal family is related by blood to the current high priestess of the Temple of Hafni.

> "Esfahan, do you know a woman called Keeara?"
> ESFAHAN nods carefully. "I met a priestess Keeara at... uncle's house."

```
Does he spot anything about MAHERA to link her to Keeara? No
Does she put 2 and 2 together? Yes but... doesn't say everything.
```

MAHERA realises the importance of many conversations she has overheard. She had been an unknowing witness to this coup for months, as religious doctrine and prophecy has slowly been rewritten to support and justify the "sacrifice of the prey to the hunters".

> MAHERA: "She has helped the plot against your family. You will not be safe while she lives."
> ESFAHAN: "Who is she?"
> "She is the head priestess and corrupter of the teachings of the Temple of Hafni. She must be removed: Hafni wills it."

FORET motions the group to follow quietly. They enter an undecorated servant's hallway. There is a tall clock with a broken mechanism; it neither ticks nor chimes but the automaton circles endlessly — an elk followed by a pack of wolves.

```
Is there anyone here? No
The next door they open is (d4) 1: A small parlour
```

"This one?" ORLEN motions and FORET holds his short sword ready to lead the way. ORLEN listens carefully but hears nothing. "I'm opening *now*."

Inside the small parlour is a single table and chair, with a body slumped in it. FORET holds his blade at arm's length as he approaches to ensure everyone's safety. The body remains still, just a body.

ORLEN walks around to examine the room in detail.

```
HUNT ROLL
Rolled 5, 4: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible
ORLEN spends the token for one gold.
```

As he moves, the eyes of the dead body begin to slowly track him round the room. ORLEN finds a painting and stops to examine it with interest. "A Castermane! I think this will do us." He lifts it carefully and turns back to the room, catching the eye of the corpse staring surreptitiously at him.

> ORLEN, drawing a sword: "I think our man here is not as sleepy as he makes out."

```
Does anyone touch him? Yes
What does he do? (d6) 6: Kick with both back legs when frightened
```

FORET steps forward with his sword to pin the man to the chair. With a squeal like a skewered animal the corpse kicks the chair wildly back and leaps up.

```
Does someone attack (1-3) FORET (4) ORLEN (5-6) Nobody? (d6) 4=ORLEN

COMBAT
Monster Endurance: 7

Weaknesses: 
- ORLEN: 4 (Hampered by the painting, which is precious to him.)
Round 1: 1d6=1

Weaknesses:
- FORET: 2 (His employer is already engaged.)
Round 2: 3d6=3,2,6

Combat total (9) greater than Monster Endurance (7). FORET +1 ruin.
```

FORET is caught off guard and ORLEN engages on his own, one hand still holding the painting. The bucking corpse is too fast and he must highlights the reason why he employs someone with a stout arm and a short sword instead of courtly duelling blades. FORET re-engages and has the table knocked at him, its edge landing on his boot. ORLEN runs it through.

It seems like FORET wants to say something about his client taking unnecessary risks, but ORLEN is too solicitous of his injury for a rebuke to land.

```
How much gold does the body give up? (7d6) 2
- Dagger sheath with a rather beautiful embroidery of complex knotwork
- Various metal coins depicting King Argiol Seo, eyes scratched out
```

FORET takes an ornate knife sheath with intricate knotwork from the de-animated corpse and ORLEN a handful of coins from an inside pocket. 

Meanwhile MAHERA and ESFAHEN stand at the door, nervous and transfixed. MAHERA had forgotten entirely about her crossbow. A solicitous smile from ORLEN breaks her out of her reverie.

```
Did anyone hear the fight? No
Do they check the next room along? No
```

They reach the end of the corridor. A set of stairs lead up, while a final door seems to lead to a food preparation area. The sound of kitchen work and smell of cooking is very clear. Up above, the sound of feasting is also evident.

> FORET: "If we wait here we'll be discovered for sure. The kitchens will have exits outside."
> ORLEN: "We'll have to risk it or turn back through the way we came. Quietly..."

```
RISK
- No relevant skill
- Devil's Bargain
- No big risk yet

Devil's Bargain: Suppress / Community
↪ The party upstairs goes quiet

RISK ROLL
Rolled 6 light: Success
```

ORLEN quietly opens the door to a corridor with open doors on both sides. At the far end is a double door to the gardens. A dumb waiter is embedded in the wall of the corridor, through which they can hear the carousing upstairs. As they pass the chatter goes quiet.

```
Does someone listen closer? (d4) 3: FORET

HUNT ROLL (+1 vigilance)
Rolled 5, 5: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible

Something terrible: Hold / Time
↪ Time stands still in the lodge

Spends one Hunt token to find: Heavy copper urn, shaped like a scaled beast with human hands and face. Its gaping mouth forms the opening.
```

ORLEN hears a single voice echoing down the shaft, "in truth we do not age in here at all, though clearly the best living is done with the scent of prey on the wind". He stops short to consider this statement and while he does, spies a heavy copper urn through the door of an open cupboard. Before the others get too far ahead he has it and runs after them.

# Scene 6. The Servants Entrance
```
Is it night now? No
Are they alone out here? No
(1-2) Adventurers (3-4) Beastbitten (5-6) Random: (d6) 4
Are they the wolves from before? Yes but... they have transformed.
Are they waiting for us? Yes but... not with malice.
How many? (d6) 3
- Helena, delicate frame, careful steps, veiled face, silently withdrawn
- Mansur, deep smile, dreadlocks, booming laugh and stream of curses
- Iman, balding, kind eyes, stuttering observational humour
```

"Ah we wondered if we would meet again." Two men and a woman stand outside in the late afternoon, drinking from small glasses. The woman looks away and lifts her veil slightly to sip her drink.

```
Do they offer a drink? Yes
Character bearing: FRIENDLY - CELEBRATION
New (1) brother (2) sister? (d2) 1
```

"I am Mansur, my companions here are Iman and Helena. Join us for a drink will you?" ORLEN takes a glass which is filled from a bottle that Mansur withdraws from inside a warm cloak. "We are celebrating another brother joining us today. Did you attend the celebration?" He points in and up, in the direction of the feasting hall.

MAHERA stares at the man, trying to tell if he is lying, if he is scheming, if he is hunting them.

```
HUNT ROLL
Rolled 5, 2: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible

Is the drink poisoned? Yes
```

The light is poor but it seems the liquid in ORLEN's glass is not the same as the drink in the others' glasses. She tries to surreptitiously avert disaster by dropping her heavy crossbow on ORLEN's foot.

```
RISK ROLL
Devil's bargain: NEGLIGENCE / WAR
↪ No matter what ORLEN is enraged

Failures:
- ORLEN's foot is injured
- the crossbow is damaged

- light die: crossbow
- light die: devil's bargain

Rolled 3, 1 light: Failure and things get worse
↪ (d2) 1=ORLEN hurts his foot and then swigs the drink anyway

Is the poison fast-acting? Yes but... not immediately debilitating
What does it do? CHANGE / DISPUTE
↪ Makes a person suggestible

ORLEN increases ruin by 1.
```

ORLEN squeals and attempts to lash out at MAHERA. He recovers his composure and takes a swig as MAHERA shouts "no!".

```
Does anyone else work out what's happening? No
```

"That's not what they're drinking!" she says, too late. Mansur laughs heartily, merry and excited. ORLEN stares into his glass while FORET, too late, draws his weapon at the nearest person.

```
Who is nearest? (d3) 3=Iman
```

Iman stutters and sweats as FORET's short blade rests on his throat. Mansur continues to laugh and Helena steps back carefully. "What did you give him?" FORET asks, pushing gently with the tip of his sword to emphasise the question.

"Just a little something to give the hunt some energy." Staring right at ORLEN he says "the game has nearly started! You must stay within the grounds of the house and you must run! So run!".

```
Has the drug still to take effect? Yes but... it won't take long.
```

ORLEN can feel the desire to flee in his bones and has one last chance at fighting before the prey-instinct takes hold.

```
RISK ROLL

What can go wrong?
- he lashes out blindly
- he kills the person who can undo the suggestion

Devil's bargain?
- he remains suggestible until a suitable cure is found
- the bottle is smashed in the struggle

Does he accept a Devil's Bargain? No

RISK ROLL
Rolled 5 light, 6 dark: Success
Dark rolled highest
↪ Ruin increases by 1.
```

In a last surge of willpower ORLEN leaps at Mansur and drives a sabre through his neck. The look of mirth on his face is frozen until it looks unnatural and the blood flowing down his front looks black in the low light.

```
COMBAT ROLL

Pack Members - Endurance 9

Combatants' Weak Points
- ORLEN (d6) 6 - will run away after first round
- FORET (d6) 2 - has one eye on ORLEN
- MAHERA (d6) 2 - dropped her crossbow

ROUND 1: 5, 4, 1 - no wins, no injuries
ORLEN runs away, (d2) 2=MAHERA inherits his Weak Point
ROUND 2: 1, 4, 5, 6 - party wins, MAHERA injured
↪ MAHERA increases ruin by 1

SCAVENGE: 4, 1, 1, 6, 2, 6, 5, 4, 2 = 2 gold
and a bottle of liquid suggestion (from Mansur)
```

FORET saw ORLEN leap into battle but didn't account for how fast Iman would be in response. MAHERA dived for the crossbow as Helena leapt the distance between them in an instant. Just as MAHERA is about to fire a bolt from a crouched position ORLEN screams and runs across her and into the gloaming. Helena slashes viciously but her long veiled robes are not so practical for hand to hand combat and the wound is painful but not deadly. A crossbow quarrel takes her in the eye as FORET slices Iman's belly open.

"Aw shit, where has he gone?"

```
Two things happening here. I'll start a clock (d6) to count down to the suggestibility wearing off. We'll start at 1 and increment it whenever a d6 roll is higher than the current value (like a Ruin roll).

But also, we'll see if the rest of the party can find ORLEN if they want. Until that point, or until the poison wears off, we'll not track where he is because he's not playable.

Suggestibility: (d6) 2
↪ Advances to 2. 

Did ESFAHEN see which way ORLEN went? No
```

"He ran in front of me but I didn't see where he went after that. Over there?" MAHERA pointed towards the an area of thick foliage that might have once been an orchard, or a hedge maze. It was getting darker now.

```
HUNT ROLL
Rolled 4, 1: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible

Terrible for ORLEN? Yes but... not catastrophic.
Has he discarded his weapons? Yes but... kept his armour.
```

FORET pulled a small jar from his pocket, containing 3 glow worms. He followed a trail through the rough grass into the bramble thicket, lit by the dim yellow wormlight. Along the way he found ORLEN duelling sabre on the ground. "Hold these" and gives them to ESFAHEN.

They stepped through a stone archway choked with vines, into the overgrown hedge maze.
