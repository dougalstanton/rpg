A brief reminder of some ad-hoc mechanics. The suggestibility poison that was given to ORLEN will wear off when the Suggestibility Clock reaches 6. It increments like a Ruin roll, ie when the value rolled is greater than the current clock. It’s currently on 2.


# Scene 7. The Hedge Maze
```
Suggestibility: (d6) 6
↪ Increase to 3.
```

They stepped through a stone archway choked with vines.

```
Is there any natural light in the maze? No
I'll start another clock for the glow worms. I'll just roll a d6 and for every 1, a glow worm goes cold.

Glow: (d6) 4 → All okay.
```

"Can you hear anything?" "I thought that was you?" "Quiet"

They heard a rustling noise behind them, from the right. But didn't they come from the left? They waited and waited, but nothing happened.

"I'll see if the trees know." FORET settled down with the jar of worms in front of him. ESFAHEN gripped MAHERA tightly, unsure whether to look at the comfort of the light or strain his eyes at the darkness. He turned to face his fate, if it came.

```
Possible Devil's Bargains, no matter what...
- the bite on his hand is altered by the ritual
- the brambles become aggitated when he becomes human again
- ORLEN is not who he claimed to be

RISK ROLL
Rolled 6 light, 4 dark: Success
DB: (d3) 2

So where is he? (1-3) centre of the maze (4-5) grounds (6) probably house: (d6) 3

While we're here, lets check on those worms.
Glow: (d6) 2 → No change.
```

"This will take time. But if I am not back in an hour... knock."

MAHERA and ESFAHEN didn't see the transformation. In a moment, the jar of worms toppled and the ground writhed beneath them. They both turned back to FORET and instead looked into the wrinkled bark on an old oak. They nestled into the gaps between the roots and stared at the worms and MAHERA's hourglass. Turning it, watching the sand fall, turning it, watching the sand fall...

```
Glow: (d6) 1 → Lost one glow worm.
Suggestibility: (d6) 6 → Wears off a bit more
How long was that (10 minute timer)? (d6) 3 
```

The tree transformed back into FORET but MAHERA and ESFAHEN had fallen asleep. Without a tree to hold them up they collapsed on top of FORET. He groaned and pitched sideways when he tried to stand. "How long?"

> MAHERA: "We must have fallen asleep on the third turn of the sand. At least half an hour."
> ESFAHEN: "What did the trees say?" then wondered aloud "What do trees normally say?"
> FORET: "He's further in the maze. Right at the centre, I think. But there's something else stalking him too."

```
I'll rule that FORET's residual tree-memory gives him a sense of the maze.
Will the brambles move around? No
Are there walls within the maze too? No
Since it's only made of trees and bushes (which aren't moving) then FORET's internal map should be sound.
```

They edged slowly in the direction FORET indicated with the remaining two worms held out in front like a talisman.

```
Suggestibility: (d6) 1 → unchanged
Glow: (d6) 4 → unchanged

Who hears something? (1) M (2) E (3) F = (d3) 1

HUNT ROLL
Rolled 5, 1: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible
↪ "The brambles have grown overhead, creating a tunnel. A thin sap drips from the thorns above."
```

"Quiet, there's a... is that rain?" MAHERA holds her hand out in the dark to catch the drops, then holds it to the thin wormlight. A sticky purple-red liquid pools in her hand.

```
Is there anything to see above? Yes but... it's not distinct
Are there more drops? Yes but... nothing else falls.
```

They looked up at the arch of vines that have grown overhead but can't see the source of the drips. MAHERA shuddered and made to go on but they had been standing still too long.

```
Whose leg do the vines grasp? (d3) 2=ESFAHEN
```

ESFAHEN dropped to the floor and the air was forced from his lungs. A thorny vine started pulling him into the deep hedge. "Help!" FORET started hacking at the vine while MAHERA tried to unwind the branches.

```
FORET hacking at the vines with his short sword.

RISK ROLL
Rolled 1 light: Failure and things get worse

Do the vines grab (1) FORET or (2) MAHERA? (d2) 1=FORET
What do they grab (1) arm (2) leg (3) torso (4) head? (d4) 1
Is he pulled off his feet? No
Does he keep his weapon? Yes
```

As he hacked the vines seem to redouble, whipping out from the bramble thicket and grasping onto ESFAHEN's other leg and FORET's sword arm.

"Give me that!" shouts MAHERA and takes the sword from FORET's hand. She swings wildly at FORET's bindings so that he can help again.

```
RISK ROLL: Free FORET's sword arm

Failure modes:
- MAHERA is bound too
- FORET is injured
- the vines take the sword

Rolled 5 dark: Success with complication
Dark rolled highest → New ruin=4

Is something (1) lost (2) gained (3) damaged (4) corrupted? (d4) 3
Is it a (1) weapon (2) reputation? (d2) 1

Do they get ESFAHEN out in the end? Yes
```

With his hand free they both set on ESFAHEN's bonds with renewed ferocity, dragging him bodily away as each bond is broken. The vines finally had to be cut off MAHERA's crossbow, rendering it useless.

```
Suggestibility: (d6) 1
Glow: (d6) 5

Do they still know where they are? No
Is it getting light yet? No
Are they being hunted? Yes but...
Hunter cannot move freely? Yes
Are they safe right now? No
```

"Shit, I... did we get turned around?" as FORET definitely leads them into a dead end. "We must have got turned around."

"Look at this, I think you were right. This way has just grown so thick. I might be able to open it."

```

RISK ROLL: open a grown-over gap through the hedge

What could go wrong?
- the gap fills with whatever is hunting them
- another entrance opens to something below
- the hedge closes around them as they pass through

Potential bargains?
- "Creating a death or murder" → Dead people on the lawn are discovered
- ORLEN is not who we think he is
- "BESTOW / BUREAUCRACY" → The inheritors return with an army

Rolled 1, 4 light, 1 dark: Success with complication

Bargain: (d3) 2 → ORLEN is not who we think he is
Complication: "TRICK / TREACHEROUS / TOOL"
Is the tool used in the ritual? No
Who has the tool? (d4) 2=ESFAHEN
Does it bring his uncle's men here? Yes but... not teleported.

```

MAHERA stands on toes, legs one behind the other and hands pressed together in front of her chest. It's hard to tell in the feeble glow from the worms whether she just stands upright or if she maybe begins to float slightly above the earth. With quiet muttering she gently spreads her arms wide and the hedgerow spreads wide in sympathy with her action.

The creaking of vines stops and she opens her eyes. It is still very dark, but the open space beyond seems less intensely dark than the deep maze they are in.

# Scene 8. Reunion
```
What is the topiary wolf doing? (d6) 2 "Leaves bristling and rustling in the wind"
Glow: (d6) 5 unchanged
Suggestibility: (d6) 2 unchanged.
```

"There's something here so we move *really* slowly" says FORET. "No, even slower than that. Shh."
```
HUNT ROLL +vigilance
Rolled 4, 1: Gain one Hunt Token but encounter something terrible
Is it the topiary wolf? Yes but...
Is there something else too? Yes
Are they engaged with each other? Yes
Is it a (1-2) hedge monster (3-4) beastbitten (5-6) royal assassin? (d6) 1
```
They enter the central area, unsure whether to stay close to the hedge or stay as far away from the hedge as possible. FORET hides the bottle of glow worms inside his cloak again.
```
FORET will spend 3 Hunt Token to achieve the goal of Rescuing ORLEN.
Where is ORLEN? Opposing a new force or old enemy
He's caught between the topiary wolf and the hedge monster.

Does ESFAHEN still have the duelling sword? Yes but... he fears to give it up.
```
The noise of the battle reaches them - a familiar cry and the whipping of the vines which were recently attacking them in the maze. And something else too, a low growl like rough bark rubbing against itself.

Realising that blind they cannot do anything, FORET moves as close to the source of noise as he can then rolls the jar of glow worms into the grass before running off at an angle. MAHERA and ESFAHEN wait at a distance, each holding a useless weapon for comfort: her crossbow damaged by the hedge monster and his borrowed sword too big for him to wield.

The giant wolf-shaped hedge turned to face the jar of worms on the grass, dark berry eyes gleaming in its foliage. At its feet lay the cowering shape of ORLEN. Briefly distracted, the hedge monster lashed out with thorny vines against the wolf's face. The two met in fierce battle and in the confusion ORLEN was able to crawl out towards FORET.
```
Suggestibility: (d6) 1
Glow: (d6) 6
No changes to either ORLEN's senses or the jar of glow worms.
```
FORET stares intently into ORLEN's eyes and commands: "You will stay with us, until this potion wears off". Then he looks back warily at the jar of glow worms, their only source of light to escape. He's going to risk returning for it.
```
RISK ROLL
Rolled 1, 6 light, 1 dark: Success
Devil's Bargain: Creating an alliance or surrender
↪ Both topiary wolf and hedge monster turn against him
```
Shoving ORLEN into the care of the two children, FORET runs full speed through the battle area to grab the jar and plunges into darkness as he stuffs it inside his cloak. There is a roar and combat ceases. Everybody holds their breath while the giant wolf sniffs for the scent, like the rustle of leaves in the wind.
