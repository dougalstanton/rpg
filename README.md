Besides the obvious "play more games, write more reports", here's some things I still want to do:

- [x] A "what the hell is this page?" to explain myself a bit
- Details of the systems used on a separate page
  - [x] YAML description of systems
  - [x] Update all other front matter accordingly
  - [x] Create summary page for these systems
  - [ ] Better explanations for the systems in my own words
  - Tool tagging
    - [x] Some sort of tagging system to describe contents
      - game rules
      - oracles
      - settings
      - adventures
      - random tables
    - [ ] And use this information on the summary page/sidebar somewhere
- [ ] Thumbnail images, maybe with nice rounded corners?
  - trad and journaling games generically
  - systems
  - campaigns/games
- [ ] Worldbuilding documents, for when I ever do them???
  - New layout?
  - Out of band (num = 0 in series?)
- [ ] Something in the side bar for each report
  - [x] systems
  - [ ] forward/back links for posts in series
  - [ ] worldbuilding document
